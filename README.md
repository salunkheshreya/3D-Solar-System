3. **Add a `.gitignore` File**

This keeps your repo clean by ignoring unnecessary files like OS junk, IDE configs, etc.

Create a file named `.gitignore` in the root with this content:

gitignore
# System files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Node or package managers (if added later)
node_modules/
dist/

# VS Code settings
.vscode/

# Logs
*.log

# Zip or videos
*.zip
*.mp4
